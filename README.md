# AndroidApp

Bugs:

Something might be wrong with the Experience logic. <br /> <br />

Dropping the tables usually dont work. <br />
If it doesnt work, simply go to your emulator, uninstall the app, and re-run. This wipes the entire database. Which means you have to re-input values into it. <br />

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required Implementations:

<strike>1) Have an options Menu.</strike> <br />
<strike>2) Have a drawer menu.</strike> <br />
<strike>3) Use an Android library: you are required to make your own Android Library and use it in the application you are implementing.</strike> <br />
<strike>4) Use an external (that is, existing) SQLite database. For this, you need to create an SQLitedatabase and use it in your app.</strike> <br />
<strike>5) Incorporate CRUD-based interactions (this is, operations) with the external database. In otherwords, your application should provide the user with features that create, update, delete, and read information about the entities you are storing in the database. Dialog boxes should be implemented and used by the create and read operations.</strike> <br />
<strike>6) Use at least two fragments.</strike> <br />
<strike>7) Use multiple Android activities.</strike> <br />
<strike>8) Your application should pass data between the activities and fragments(two-way-communication).</strike> <br />
<strike>9) Use custom dialog boxes (that is, DialogFragments and not the built-in AlertDialog.Builder) for data input/gathering.</strike> <br />
<strike>10) Pass data (embedded in intents) between the activities.</strike> <br />
<strike>11) Use a RecyclerView that allows to display a list of items with the possibility to change its layout manager at runtime (just like what has been demonstrated in class).</strike> <br />
<strike>12) Use at least two layout managers (other than linear layout manager).</strike> <br />
<strike>13) Use your own custom styles: color, dimensions, etc.</strike> <br />
<strike>14) Use event listeners other than the click listener. Example: touch, swipe, keyboard, etc.</strike> <br />
<strike>15) Use Android notification: your application should generate notifications with embedded actions of your choice. <br />
<strike>16) SQLITE database: your database must contain at least 3 tables.</strike> <br />
<strike>17) Use the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern: as instructed and demonstrated in class.</strike> <br />
<strike>18) Shared preferences or raw files to persist any kind of data. For example, caching the responses of API calls, user actions, user profile, etc.</strike> <br />
<strike>19) Playing sound: using the Android MediaPlayer class. <br />
<strike>20) Localization: the user interface (UI) of your application should be available in two different languages. That is, English and any other language of your choice. <br />
<strike>21) Networking: your application should consume at least one web service (REST-based API) that provides JSON data of your choice. Bear in mind that your choice of API must be consistent, relevant and somehow related to the context of your application.</strike> <br />
<strike>22) Document your application in a README.md (Markdown document). <br />
