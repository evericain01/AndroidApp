<b>App Name</b>: Knowledge+ (Quiz App) <br /> 
<b>Team Members</b>: Alex Vasil, Christian David, Ebrahim Vericain <br /> <br />

This android application is similar to any other quiz application in which someone would find in a mobile app store market. <br /> <br />
As the user opens the app, it asks them to register and create a profile . Once the user has done those tasks, they will be presented with their starting level (Level 0). The amount of experience point needed to level up will be indicated in the main page of the application, as well as the user’s current level. As for the quiz selection, the application will give the user a choice of various categories (e.g.: sports, arts, etc.). The type of quiz (True/False or Multiple Choice), difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard), and the number of questions is all up to the user’s selection as well. <br /> <br />

What makes our different than other quiz apps?
-	A queue system is implemented in the application. The user will be allowed to view, add, delete, play a specific quiz selection which will be added to their “queue” if they want to save that quiz for later. Should the user logout and log back in, their queue is still saved.

-	A suggestion system is another unique implementation we decided to add. Once the user has completed a quiz, a couple of links will be shown to the user. These links are based on the category the user has selected for their quiz. We implemented this system to allow the user to improve their skills on that specific category.
